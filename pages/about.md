I'm a generalist, with experience in technology, education and product. Currently working as a Product Manager for [eLife](https://elifesciences.org/), previously doing CX at [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/), learning tech. at [Falmouth Uni](https://www.falmouth.ac.uk/) and teaching music tech. [DMU](https://dmu.ac.uk) and [Warwickshire College](https://wcg.ac.uk/).

I'm really enjoying the world of Product Management and love talking to fellow PMs about creating joyful, open and equitable experiences.

I work from home in South Devon, and have ended up here via stints in the New Forest, Cornwall and Leicester (where I grew up).

Outside of work, I like anything to do with plants and water.
